\section{Conclusion}

Throughout this project, we have effectively established a state machine for Ethernet frame generation on the Digilent Nexys4-DDR FPGA Board. The system has been configured to facilitate data transmission adhering to the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard. Further, we developed a module capable of capturing audio via the onboard MEMS PDM microphone, processing the signal through an FFT algorithm, and subsequently transmitting the data over Ethernet. This undertaking has showcased the harmonious integration of signal-processing techniques with robust network communication protocols.

In the post-processing phase, we utilized tools such as Wireshark for packet capture and Python scripts for data visualization, which collectively affirmed the reliability and precision of our system. The graphical depictions of the audio signal processing substantiate the project's effectiveness in fulfilling its objectives.

While the project's primary aims have been attained, the scope for advancement persists. Future work could involve optimization of the FPGA resource utilization, exploration of more complex signal processing techniques, or the incorporation of real-time visual output on a VGA monitor, thereby broadening the project's applicability and efficiency.
