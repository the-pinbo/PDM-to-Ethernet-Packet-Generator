2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock eth_rst_gen_i/gen_50M/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock eth_rst_gen_i/gen_50M/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin eth_rst_gen_i/gen_50M/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net CLK_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): CLK_IBUF_inst/O, eth_rst_gen_i/CLK, rst_gen_i/CLK
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) ETH_CRSDV direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (ETH_CRSDV) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#2 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) ETH_RXD[0] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (ETH_RXD[0]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#3 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) ETH_RXD[1] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (ETH_RXD[1]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell eth_rst_gen_i/lfsr_q[31]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[25]/PRE,
packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[26]/PRE,
packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[27]/PRE,
packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[28]/PRE,
packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[29]/PRE,
packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[2]/PRE,
packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[30]/PRE,
packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[31]/PRE,
packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[3]/PRE,
packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[4]/PRE,
packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[5]/PRE,
packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[6]/PRE,
packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[7]/PRE,
packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[8]/PRE,
packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[9]/PRE (the first 15 of 32 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell rst_gen_i/gen_50M_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) eth_rst_gen_i/gen_50M/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/RST. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on RST_N relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>
